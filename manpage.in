The moon-buggy is controlled by a couple of keys, which are described
near the bottom of the screen.  Most important are the following keys.

makes your car jump.  The length of a jump is fixed and you can only
start a new jump, while the wheels have contact to the ground.
.IP "a, l"
fires the mining laser.  The laser is used to remove stones, which may
block your way.

enter the highscore list.
