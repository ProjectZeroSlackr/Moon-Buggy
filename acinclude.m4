dnl The idea of this tests, is to be as simple, as possible.
dnl The only special case we check for, is old versions of
dnl ncurses.  Any other problems must be handled by the user
dnl via configure's --with-curses-includedir,
dnl --with-curses-header, and --with-curses-libs options.

AC_DEFUN(AC_CHECK_CURSES,[
  dnl step 1: find the correct preprocessor flags
  dnl         This is completely left to the user.

  dnl step 2: find the correct header file name
  dnl         When nothing is specified on the command line, we try to guess.
  AC_ARG_WITH(curses-header,
    [  --with-curses-header[=ARG]
                          the curses header file name (including brackets)

  dnl step 3: try to find the correct linker flags
  dnl         When nothing is specified on the command line, we try to guess.
  AC_ARG_WITH(curses-libs,
    [  --with-curses-libs[=ARG]
                          the -l and -L linker flags for the curses library
